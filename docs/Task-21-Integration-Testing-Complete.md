## Technical Implementation Details

### 🏗️ Test Infrastructure Architecture

#### Test Environment Setup
```python
@pytest.fixture
async def test_environment(self, tmp_path):
    """Complete test environment with all DevGuard components"""
    # Creates isolated test environment with:
    # - Mock repositories with Git integration
    # - Test configuration with all agents enabled
    # - Shared memory and vector database setup
    # - Mock LLM provider with configurable responses
```

#### Mock Framework Integration
- **AsyncMock Integration** for asynchronous LLM provider simulation
- **Patch Decorators** for component isolation and dependency injection
- **Response Simulation** with configurable delays and failures
- **State Injection** for testing specific error conditions

#### Agent Coordination Testing
```python
# Example: Multi-agent workflow validation
env["mock_llm"].chat_completion.side_effect = [
    # Commander Agent response
    AsyncMock(content='{"task_type": "code_generation", "agent": "code"}'),
    # Planner Agent response  
    AsyncMock(content='{"subtasks": [...], "dependencies": [...]}'),
    # Code Agent execution
    AsyncMock(content='{"success": true, "files_modified": [...]}'),
]
```

### 🔧 Resilience Testing Patterns

#### Failure Injection Framework
```python
async def failing_completion(*args, **kwargs):
    nonlocal failure_count
    failure_count += 1
    if failure_count <= 2:
        raise ConnectionError("LLM provider temporarily unavailable")
    return AsyncMock(content='{"success": true, "recovered": true}')
```

#### State Verification Patterns
```python
# Verify error recovery was logged
error_entries = env["shared_memory"].search_entries(
    tags={"error", "recovery"}
)
assert len(error_entries) > 0, "Error recovery not logged"
```

#### Performance Benchmarking
```python
# Throughput measurement
start_time = time.time()
for request in requests:
    result = await swarm.process_user_request(request)
end_time = time.time()

requests_per_second = successful_requests / (end_time - start_time)
assert requests_per_second >= 5.0, "Throughput below target"
```
