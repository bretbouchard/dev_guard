# üìÑ RFP: Autonomous Multi-Agent Developer Swarm System

**Project Name:** `dev_guard`  
**Prepared For:** Internal Engineering or DevOps Team  
**Date:** 2025-08-05

---

## üß≠ Overview

`dev_guard` is a **LangGraph-powered, local-first, autonomous development swarm** composed of intelligent agents designed to continuously monitor, enhance, and refactor codebases based on user-defined requirements, code changes, and best practices.

This system will serve a **single developer (you)** but operate across multiple private and public Git repositories. It will read, update, and maintain:
- Code
- Documentation
- APIs
- Dependencies
- System design patterns
- Project structure and versioning

It will operate with minimal user intervention by learning from your preferences, commit patterns, file structures, and historical decisions. All behavior is coordinated via **LangGraph and shared memory**, forming a **hive mind** of specialized agents that act without needing central approval but whose actions are always visible to the top-level observer or user.

---

## üß© Core Objectives

The system must:

1. Operate as a **multi-agent swarm** via LangGraph with shared memory.
2. Maintain long-term **context, learning, and preferences** using a vector database.
3. Automatically **read and apply requirement, design, and TODO files**.
4. **Continuously ingest** code and document changes from **all Git repositories** (even if not actively worked on).
5. Detect if **changes in one repo impact others**, and generate tasks to fix those issues.
6. Track and manage **dependencies and versioning** across repos.
   - Auto-upgrade when possible
   - Log justification when pinned/older versions are necessary
7. Provide a **notification system** for edge-case decisions or critical events.
8. Operate **offline using Ollama + GPT-OSS-20b**, but allow cloud LLM fallback.
9. Include a **replay and audit trail** of tasks, changes, errors, and decisions.
10. Support optional **voice/iOS input**, task injection, and human overrides.

## üß† Agent Roles and Responsibilities

| Agent Name               | Role                                                                 |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Commander Agent**      | Oversees system, communicates with user, monitors swarm state        |
| **Planner Agent**        | Breaks tasks into subtasks, assigns to appropriate agents            |
| **Code Agent**           | Uses Goose or LLM to generate/refactor/modify code                   |
| **QA/Test Agent**        | Runs linting, type checks, and tests. Handles retries                |
| **Docs Agent**           | Updates markdown and docstrings based on code or design changes      |
| **Git Watcher Agent**    | Monitors all repos for diffs and logs metadata                       |
| **Impact Mapper Agent**  | Analyzes changes and determines whether they affect other repos/docs |
| **Repo Auditor Agent**   | Scans repos for missing/important files to be ingested               |
| **Dep Manager Agent**    | Tracks and upgrades dependencies, logs reasons for pinned versions   |

All agents have access to:
- Shared memory
- Vector database (embedding index of all code/docs)
- History of past tasks and failures

## üîê Security & Privacy

- All operations run locally unless explicitly opted in.
- Git credentials are handled through existing SSH or token auth.
- No vector data or file content is transmitted externally by default.
- Swarm behavior is explainable, observable, and auditable.

---

## üì© Next Steps

- Approve or revise RFP scope.
- Choose implementation team or request code scaffolding.
- Define first milestone (LangGraph base + memory engine suggested).
